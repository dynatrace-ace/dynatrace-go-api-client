	Threshold int32 `json:"threshold"`
	// Sensitivity of the threshold.   With `low` sensitivity, high statistical confidence is used. Brief violations (for example, due to a surge in load) won't trigger alerts.   With `high` sensitivity, no statistical confidence is used. Each violation triggers alert.
