type MetricEventDimensions struct {
	// Defines the actual set of fields depending on the value. See one of the following objects:   * `ENTITY` -> MetricEventEntityDimensions  * `STRING` -> MetricEventStringDimensions  
	FilterType string `json:"filterType"`
	// The dimensions name. Sending this has no effect while creating a configuration, as only the *index* of the dimension is used here -> dimension names might change, indexes not.

	// The dimensions index on the metric.
	Index int32 `json:"index"`
