# FailureRateIncreaseThresholdConfig

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Threshold** | **int32** | Failure rate during any 5-minute period to trigger an alert, %. | 
**Sensitivity** | **string** | Sensitivity of the threshold.   With &#x60;low&#x60; sensitivity, high statistical confidence is used. Brief violations (for example, due to a surge in load) won&#39;t trigger alerts.   With &#x60;high&#x60; sensitivity, no statistical confidence is used. Each violation triggers alert. |
