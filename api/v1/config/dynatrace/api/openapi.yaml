    Documentation of the Dynatrace Configuration API. Refer to the [help page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/config-api) to read about use-cases and examples.

    Notes about compatibility:
    * Operations marked as early adopter or preview may be changed in non-compatible ways, although we try to avoid this.
    * We may add new enum constants without incrementing the API version; thus, clients need to handle unknown enum constants gracefully.
