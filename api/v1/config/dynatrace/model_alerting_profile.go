For all filters that are *negated* inside of these event filters, that is all \"Predefined\" as well as \"Custom\" (Title and/or Description) ones the AND logic applies. For all *non-negated* ones the OR logic applies. Between these two groups, negated and non-negated, the AND logic applies.   If you specify both severity rule and event filter, the AND logic applies.
