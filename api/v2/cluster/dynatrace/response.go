/*
 * Dynatrace Cluster API
 *
 * Dynatrace Managed exposes cluster-wide functionality via REST endpoints. This interactive documentation also acts as a REST client you can use to interact with Dynatrace Managed clusters.   To authorize, use the API Token generated in [Settings - API Tokens page](/cmc#cm/apiToken). The HTTP status code of the response shows the result of your request. The expected response code for a successful request is documented individually per REST endpoint. Additionally the following error response codes can occur in our REST interface:  * 400 - Bad Request: Some request parameters are not correct. See response body for details. * 401 - Unauthorized: A valid authorization header is required but is missing. * 403 - Forbidden: Execution of request is not allowed, e.g. api-token is invalid. * 404 - Not Found: Endpoint does not exist or some entities could not be found. * 500 - Internal Server Error: See response body for details. * 556 - Upgrade in progress: Operation couldn't be performed during the upgrade.  Notes about compatibility: * Operations marked as early adopter or preview may be changed in non-compatible ways, although we try to avoid this. * We may add new enum constants without incrementing the API version; thus, clients need to handle unknown enum constants gracefully.
 *
 * API version: 2.0
