## DeleteTags

> DeletedEntityTags DeleteTags(ctx).Key(key).EntitySelector(entitySelector).Value(value).DeleteAllWithKey(deleteAllWithKey).From(from).To(to).Execute()

Deletes the specified tag from the specified entities

### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    openapiclient "./openapi"
)

func main() {
    key := "key_example" // string | The tag to be deleted.
    entitySelector := "entitySelector_example" // string | Specifies the entities where you want to delete tags.   You must set one of these criteria:   * Entity type: `type(\"TYPE\")`  * Dynatrace entity ID: `entityId(\"id\")`. You can specify several IDs, separated by a comma (`entityId(\"id-1\",\"id-2\")`).   You can add one or several of the following criteria. Values are case-sensitive and the `EQUALS` operator is used unless otherwise specified.   * Tag: `tag(\"value\")`. Tags in `[context]key:value`, `key:value`, and `value` formats are detected and parsed automatically. Any colons (`:`) that are part of the key or value must be escaped with a backslash(`\\`), otherwise, it will be interpreted as the separator between the key and the value. All tag values are case-sensitive.  * Management zone ID: `mzId(123)`  * Management zone name: `mzName(\"value\")` * Entity name: `entityName(\"value\")`. By default this filters for entities, whose name **contains** the given value and is **not** case sensitive.   The following modifications are available:  * `entityName.equals`: changes the operator to `EQUALS`.   * `entityName.startsWith`: changes the operator to `BEGINS WITH`.   * `entityName.in`: enables you to provide multiple values. The `EQUALS` operator applies.   * `caseSensitive(entityName(\"value\"))`: takes any entity name criterion as an arguments and makes the value case-sensitive. * Health state (HEALTHY,UNHEALTHY): `healthState(\"HEALTHY\")` * First seen timestamp: `firstSeenTms.<operator>(now-3h)`. Use any timestamp format from the **from**_/_**to** parameters.   The following operators are available:  * `lte`: earlier than or at the specified time  * `lt`: earlier than the specified time  * `gte`: later than or at the specified time  * `gt`: later than the specified time * Entity attribute: `<attribute>(\"value1\",\"value2\")` and `<attribute>.exists()`. To fetch the list of available attributes, execute the [GET all entity types](https://dt-url.net/dw03s7h) and check the **properties** field.  * Relationships: `fromRelationships.<relationshipName>()` and `toRelationships.<relationshipName>()`. The criterion takes an entity selector as an attribute. To fetch the list of available relationships, execute the [GET all entity types](https://dt-url.net/dw03s7h) and check the **fromRelationships** and **toRelationships** fields. * Negation: `not(<criterion>)`. Inverts any criterion except for **type**.   For more information, see [Entity selector](https://dt-url.net/apientityselector) in Dynatrace Documentation.   To set several criteria, separate them with a comma (`,`). For example, `type(\"HOST\"),healthState(\"HEALTHY\")`. Only results matching **all** criteria are included in response.   The length of the string is limited to 10,000 characters.   
    value := "value_example" // string | The tag to be deleted. (optional)
    deleteAllWithKey := true // bool | The tag to be deleted. (optional)
    from := "from_example" // string | The start of the requested timeframe.   You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds.  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional.  * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week.  You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`.  Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:     * `m`: minutes     * `h`: hours     * `d`: days     * `w`: weeks     * `M`: months     * `y`: years   If not set, the relative timeframe of 24 hours is used (`now-24h`). (optional)
    to := "to_example" // string | The end of the requested timeframe.   You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds.  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional.  * Relative timeframe, back from now.

Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:     * `m`: minutes     * `h`: hours     * `d`: days     * `w`: weeks     * `M`: months     * `y`: years   If not set, the current timestamp is used. (optional)

Any colons (`:`) that are part of the key or value must be escaped with a backslash(`\\`), otherwise, it will be interpreted as the separator between the key and the value. All tag values are case-sensitive.  * Management zone ID: `mzId(123)`  * Management zone name: `mzName(\"value\")` * Entity name: `entityName(\"value\")`. By default this filters for entities, whose name **contains** the given value and is **not** case sensitive.   The following modifications are available:  * `entityName.equals`: changes the operator to `EQUALS`.   * `entityName.startsWith`: changes the operator to `BEGINS WITH`.   * `entityName.in`: enables you to provide multiple values. The `EQUALS` operator applies.   * `caseSensitive(entityName(\"value\"))`: takes any entity name criterion as an arguments and makes the value case-sensitive. * Health state (HEALTHY,UNHEALTHY): `healthState(\"HEALTHY\")` * First seen timestamp: `firstSeenTms.<operator>(now-3h)`. Use any timestamp format from the **from**_/_**to** parameters.   The following operators are available:  * `lte`: earlier than or at the specified time  * `lt`: earlier than the specified time  * `gte`: later than or at the specified time  * `gt`: later than the specified time * Entity attribute: `<attribute>(\"value1\",\"value2\")` and `<attribute>.exists()`. To fetch the list of available attributes, execute the [GET all entity types](https://dt-url.net/dw03s7h) and check the **properties** field.  * Relationships: `fromRelationships.<relationshipName>()` and `toRelationships.<relationshipName>()`. The criterion takes an entity selector as an attribute. To fetch the list of available relationships, execute the [GET all entity types](https://dt-url.net/dw03s7h) and check the **fromRelationships** and **toRelationships** fields. * Negation: `not(<criterion>)`. Inverts any criterion except for **type**.   For more information, see [Entity selector](https://dt-url.net/apientityselector) in Dynatrace Documentation.   To set several criteria, separate them with a comma (`,`). For example, `type(\"HOST\"),healthState(\"HEALTHY\")`. Only results matching **all** criteria are included in response.   The length of the string is limited to 10,000 characters.   
    from := "from_example" // string | The start of the requested timeframe.   You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds.  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional.  * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week.  You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`.  Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:     * `m`: minutes     * `h`: hours     * `d`: days     * `w`: weeks     * `M`: months     * `y`: years   If not set, the relative timeframe of 24 hours is used (`now-24h`). (optional)
    to := "to_example" // string | The end of the requested timeframe.   You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds.  * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional.  * Relative timeframe, back from now.

(optional)
    addEntityTags := *openapiclient.NewAddEntityTags([]openapiclient.AddEntityTag{*openapiclient.NewAddEntityTag("Key_example")}) // AddEntityTags | The JSON body of the request. Contains tags to be added to the matching entities. (optional)

    configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
    api_client := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    resp, r, err := api_client.MonitoredEntitiesCustomTagsApi.PostTags(context.Background()).EntitySelector(entitySelector).From(from).To(to).AddEntityTags(addEntityTags).Execute()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `MonitoredEntitiesCustomTagsApi.PostTags``: %v\n", err)
